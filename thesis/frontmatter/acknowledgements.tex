\begin{document}
I would like to express my deep gratitude to Professor David Wehlau and Professor Imed Zaguia, my research advisors, 
for introducing me to this exciting field of study and for their patient guidance and encouragement throughout.
I would particularly like to thank Professor David Wehlau for going above and beyond in providing useful critiques of this research work.
A special thank you goes to Professor Michael Albert for making his PermLab software publicly available, 
without which much of this research would have been exceptionally tedious.
Finally, I wish to thank my family and friends for their constant support and encouragement throughout my studies,
and especially for their additional support during my sudden transition back home 
due to the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic.
